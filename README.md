A minimalistic cookiecutter template for small python projects using `uv` for dependency management.

It supports the following features:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- Code quality with [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [deptry](https://github.com/fpgmaas/deptry/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/)
- Documentation with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Compatibility testing for multiple versions of Python with [tox-uv](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox-uv)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with automated testing, documentation deployment, and security scanning
- **Enterprise GitHub support** with SSH-first authentication

## Quickstart

On your local machine, navigate to the directory in which you want to create a project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/matrig/minicookiecutter.git
```

You'll be prompted to configure your project:

- **github_actions** [y/n]: Enable GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- **codecov** [y/n]: Enable Codecov integration for coverage reporting
- **mkdocs** [y/n]: Include MkDocs documentation setup
- **git_repo** [y/n]: Initialize git repository and optionally create remote

## GitHub Actions Features

When you enable GitHub Actions (`github_actions: y`), your generated project includes:

### ðŸš€ **Continuous Integration (CI)**

- **Multi-Python testing**: Automatically tests your code on Python 3.9-3.13
- **Multi-OS testing**: Tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- **Code quality checks**: Automated linting (ruff), formatting, and type checking (mypy)
- **Coverage reporting**: Optional integration with Codecov

### ðŸ“š **Documentation Deployment**

- **Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages**: Documentation automatically updates when you push to main
- **MkDocs integration**: Works seamlessly if you enable MkDocs

### ðŸ”’ **Security Scanning**

- **CodeQL analysis**: GitHub's native security scanning
- **Dependency scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection with Safety
- **Scheduled security checks**: Weekly automated scans

### ðŸ“ˆ **Professional Setup**

Your generated project gets enterprise-grade CI/CD that:

- âœ… Prevents bad code from being merged
- âœ… Automatically deploys documentation
- âœ… Monitors for security vulnerabilities
- âœ… Works with both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise
